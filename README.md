# Agent_obstacle_avoidance_RL
The repository provides code for training an agent to avoid obstacle in a maze using Reinforcement learning.

The maze used in this code is similar to the one shown below


R 0 0 0 0 X  
0 0 0 0 0 X  
0 0 X X X X  
0 0 X 0 0 X  
0 0 0 0 0 0   
X X X X X 0 <- here's the end  

You can vary the exploration rate, i.e. random factor, and number of episodes to see the effects. 

Reducing the random exploration would result in less number of episodes will using higher value for exploration will take more episodes to learn avoiding obstacles.
